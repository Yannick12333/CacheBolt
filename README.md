## Usage

CacheBolt is designed to be simple to use. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to run it:

1. Start CacheBolt with default settings:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/cachebolt
   ```

2. Access the API through the configured endpoint (default is `http://localhost:8080`).

3. Send requests to your backend services, and CacheBolt will handle caching automatically.

## Configuration

CacheBolt uses a straightforward configuration file to manage settings. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

```toml
[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8080

[cache]
enabled = true
ttl = 300 # Time to live in seconds

[backend]
type = "redis"
url = "redis://localhost:6379"
```

### Configuration Options

- **server.host**: The host on which CacheBolt will run.
- **server.port**: The port for incoming requests.
- **cache.enabled**: Enable or disable caching.
- **cache.ttl**: Time-to-live for cached items.
- **backend.type**: Specify the backend type (e.g., `redis`, `s3`, etc.).
- **backend.url**: The URL for connecting to the backend.

## Supported Backends

CacheBolt supports multiple backends for object storage. Here are the currently supported options:

- **Redis**: Fast in-memory data structure store.
- **Amazon S3**: Scalable object storage service.
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Durable and highly available object storage.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Massively scalable object storage for unstructured data.

You can configure your preferred backend in the configuration file.
